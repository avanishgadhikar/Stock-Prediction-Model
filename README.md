# Stock-Prediction-Model

## Predicting Stock Price Movement using LSTMs:
Predicting Microsoft(MSFT) stock price movement based on the daily closing price. Creating a custom LSTM model, and training it based on a window of past 3 working days. Thereafter checking for which intervals the model works and figuring out the reasoning behind it.

## Dataset: 
The dataset is obtained from yfinance and a link to the same can be obtained here


## RESULTS:
We can see here that the minute there is a big change as seen in the rise of stock in 2023-Nov, the model is unable to predict it and thus fails to predict that data, but if the change is not much, the model can track it pretty well. We can see how it is unable to predict the volatility in the stock prices, and thus its uses are solely limited to this learning based project.
